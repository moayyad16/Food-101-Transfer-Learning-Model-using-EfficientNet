# Food-101-Transfer-Learning-Model-using-EfficientNet
## Introduction
Welcome to the Food-101 Transfer Learning Model repository! Here, a robust solution for food image classification leveraging the power of transfer learning with the state-of-the-art EfficientNet architecture is presented. In this repository, a comprehensive framework for building, training, and evaluating a deep learning model tailored specifically for the Food-101 dataset is encapsulated.

Food recognition from images is challenged by the vast diversity of food types, variations in presentation, lighting conditions, and occlusions. This challenge is addressed by the Food-101 dataset, offering a large-scale collection of food images spanning 101 different categories, including popular dishes, fruits, vegetables, desserts, and more. With a total of 101,000 images, this dataset provides a rich resource for training and evaluating food classification models.

In this project, the remarkable capabilities of transfer learning, a technique that enables knowledge learned from pre-trained models on large datasets to be leveraged and adapted to specific tasks, are harnessed. The EfficientNet architecture, renowned for its superior performance in balancing model size and accuracy by intelligently scaling network width, depth, and resolution, is employed. By fine-tuning the pre-trained weights of the EfficientNet model on the Food-101 dataset, exceptional accuracy and robustness in food image classification are aimed for.

## Model Details 
The model is based on transfer learning using the EfficientNet architecture, which has demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks. By fine-tuning the pre-trained weights on the Food-101 dataset, the model's ability to accurately classify food images across diverse categories is enhanced.

The model still can be improved. We can utilize a more advanced version of EfficientNet, implement data augmentation, data scaling, or normalization, and perform parameter fine-tuning. All of these steps can enhance the model's adaptability and effectiveness.
